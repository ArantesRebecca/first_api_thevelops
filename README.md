# first_api_thevelops

<b>#Description</b><br>
this API was developed for theVelops's internship selection process

<b>#How to use</b> <br>
First of all is necessary to have the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> and <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">git bash</a> installed in your machine. Then you'll be able to clone this repository and run it. 
In your terminal type the command -npm install, this will install the Node Package Manager wich helps to manage the js modules.
The next steps are install the dependencies with npm install and type npm start to initiate the server.
For execute the tests and see how it's working you can use <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">postman</a> and use the url http://localhost:3000/users because the server is hosted in the 3000 port. On postman is possible to test the routes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE avaliable in this API.
